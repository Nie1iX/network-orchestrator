# E2E testing

## Browser sandbox on macOS

```bash
npm run dev:sandbox
# Open http://localhost:1422 in a browser.
npm run test:sandbox
```

The sandbox uses synthetic WireGuard, OpenVPN, Xray subscription, and static
route profiles. All IPC calls are intercepted by Tauri's mock transport and
handled in memory. There is no native-command fallback, VPN process, file
import, subscription HTTP request, keyring write, OS route, DNS, or proxy
mutation. Unknown commands, interface changes, elevation, backend installation,
and process restart are rejected. The installer refuses to run in a native
Tauri window. Production builds exclude the sandbox.

The green banner identifies this mode. Reload resets the synthetic backend;
connection snippets use this browser origin's localStorage and survive reload.
File dialogs and confirmations return synthetic choices. Subscription delays,
config analysis, conflicts, and traffic counters are fixtures. IPv4 lookup is
simulated; IPv6 parsing, bulk CIDR parsing, OpenVPN probes, and real config
generation are covered by Rust tests instead. Do not use sandbox results as
evidence that real VPN credentials or connectivity work.

## Native proxy connections verification — 2026-10-01

The native client starts Xray in loopback SOCKS/HTTP mode and can drive the
macOS system proxy. RED: bridge tests rejected `runtime`, `connect` and
`set_system_proxy` as unknown; core tests lacked the macOS Xray layout and
`MacProxyAdapter`. GREEN: core managed Xray (synthetic archives plus the
official `Xray-macos-arm64-v8a.zip` via `XRAY_MACOS_ARCHIVE`, SHA-256
`9b99a351…63d6`), macOS proxy adapter on a fake `networksetup` runner
(service filtering, snapshot, loopback-only apply, restore, manager round
trip), and bridge runtime refusals/state passed.

Live acceptance (`NETORCH_LIVE_XRAY`): verified install from the official zip,
share-link import, connect, `curl` to https://www.youtube.com/ through the
client SOCKS port via a loopback VLESS server returned 200, then disconnect
and shutdown left no Xray process. The loopback server resolves over DoH:
with incy connected the system resolver returns fake IPs in 240.0.0.0/4,
which Xray's freedom outbound refuses as reserved.

Manual checks on the host, each restored immediately: `networksetup` can set
proxies without sudo for an admin user; while incy (packet tunnel on utun9)
is the primary service, proxies on Wi-Fi/Ethernet appear only under
`__SCOPED__` and the global proxy stays empty; proxies set on the incy service
itself are ignored. Hence the in-app override warning. No real user profile
was used.

## Native subscription URL verification — 2026-09-30

Import → Subscription now fetches HTTP/HTTPS URLs in the native client, with
optional HWID and profile name. Tauri and SwiftUI share subscription parsing,
import and managed configuration storage. Plain-text, padded/unpadded standard
Base64 and URL-safe Base64 lists are supported. Native connection cards offer
a server selector; selection only rewrites the saved configuration. Automatic
subscription refresh remains unavailable in this native stage.

RED: the bridge rejected `import_subscription` as an unknown method. GREEN:
479 Rust workspace tests and 11 Swift tests passed, including a local fake
HTTP import, HWID transmission, endpoint switching, redaction, invalid URLs,
empty/unsupported subscription bodies, save rollback, HTTP errors, the 1 MiB
response limit and HWID removal on cross-origin redirects. Existing Tauri
subscription tests passed after the shared import replaced its local copy.
The total fetch timeout is 30 seconds; redirects are limited to five and
HTTPS downgrade redirects are rejected. No real subscription URL was used.

Formatting, workspace check, strict Clippy, localization/sandbox tests and
frontend production build passed. The signed local native app also built.
Release build tools retain metadata to avoid stripping the `rustversion`
proc macro; the application remains stripped. Offscreen native acceptance
rendered 64 images under `target/macos/subscription-preview`, including both
import dialogs and a subscription server picker in both languages and themes.
These renders do not claim foreground native UI automation.

## Share-link import verification — 2026-09-30

Both clients offer Import → Link for a single `vless://`, `hysteria2://` or
`hy2://` connection, with an optional name. The shared Rust import stores a
private generated Xray revision, assigns distinct loopback proxy ports and
cleans the revision up if profile persistence fails. The Windows path keeps
DPAPI protection. Import never starts a tunnel or changes routes, DNS or the
system proxy. At that stage, HTTPS subscription fetching was only available
in Tauri; native support is recorded in the subscription verification above.

RED: the native bridge acceptance test initially rejected `import_share_link`
as an unknown method. GREEN: 473 workspace Rust tests, 10 Swift tests, seven
sandbox tests and ten localization tests passed, along with formatting,
workspace check, strict Clippy and the production frontend build. Native
acceptance rendered 60 images across both languages and themes, including
the new link dialog, under `target/macos/link-preview`.

Browser acceptance used a temporary sandbox tab: empty input disabled import;
an HTTPS URL produced a translated validation error; VLESS imported with its
fragment name; Hysteria2 imported with a custom Russian name. The form cleared
after success, all connections stayed off, and the temporary tab was closed.
Actual configuration generation, managed storage, rollback and duplicate IDs
were checked with synthetic Rust/Swift fixtures, rather than real credentials.
Native images are offscreen renders, not foreground UI automation.

## Local verification record — 2026-09-30

The app was launched on macOS with an isolated QA application identifier.
Browser checks used the sandbox above. Real Linux network checks used disposable
ARM64 Ubuntu containers in a separate Docker bridge with no published ports,
host networking, Docker socket mount, or user VPN files. WireGuard keys and
OpenVPN certificates/credentials were generated for the test peers. The initial
internal-only bridge prevented the full-tunnel underlay probe; the successful
run used the private bridge arrangement from the existing E2E contract.

This was a review of the main paths across core, daemon, Tauri commands, and
React, backed by tests and UI checks. It is not an exhaustive proof that every
line or every platform-specific path is correct.

| Area | Verification | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS workspace | fmt, all-target check, strict clippy, workspace tests | 459 Rust tests passed |
| Linux x86_64 core + daemon | Docker Rust tests, daemon release build | 539 tests passed, including doc tests |
| Linux ARM64 core + daemon | fmt, strict all-target clippy, Rust tests | 530 tests passed, including doc tests |
| Frontend | TypeScript + production Vite build; pure sandbox tests | build passed; 6 tests passed; sandbox absent from dist |
| Native macOS shell | Tauri dev startup with QA identifier | launched; real host VPN connections were not attempted |
| Profiles UI | create static route, edit WireGuard, import file/subscription, delete, search/group controls | synthetic data only; passed |
| Connection UI | four concurrent backends, OpenVPN credential prompt, disconnect, save/apply connection snippet | synthetic data only; passed |
| Subscription UI | endpoint selection, refresh, interval, delay, disabled edits while active | synthetic data only; passed |
| Network and routes UI | adapters/details, route overview/table/tree/flow/by-interface, IPv4 longest-prefix lookup | synthetic data only; passed; display findings below |
| Recovery/settings UI | cleanup, diagnostics, always-on enable/disable and edit guard, login autostart, auth mode, executable selection/reset | synthetic data only; passed |
| Linux daemon | existing scenarios.sh, including IPv4/IPv6, policy rules, polkit/uid isolation, journal, restart/cleanup, 1,000 routes | all 45 checks passed |
| WireGuard | existing wg_scenarios.py, real split/full traffic, DNS, crash recovery, always-on | all 28 checks passed |
| OpenVPN | existing ovpn_scenarios.py, real split/full traffic, pushed DNS, crash recovery | all 19 checks passed |
| OpenVPN authentication/probe | existing ovpn_auth_scenarios.py | all 4 checks passed |
| Static always-on | existing always_on_scenarios.sh, pause/resume, repair, late interface, uid isolation | passed |
| Real Xray proxy/TUN | unit tests and sandbox only in this session | real traffic not verified; pinned Linux managed package is x86_64-only |
| Windows system proxy, DPAPI, UAC, tunnel services; desktop Linux polkit prompts/tray | applicable ordinary unit tests only | VM acceptance still required |
| Real subscription service / user's VPN | not used | network/provider behavior remains unverified |

### Reproduced and corrected

- macOS compilation accessed a nonexistent `net_route::Route.metric`; use the
  platform field only on Linux/Windows and an explicit unavailable-metric
  fallback elsewhere. Route conversion has a regression test.
- The Linux daemon's orchestration/process modules were exposed on macOS even
  though their DNS, D-Bus, and libc dependencies were Linux-only. Gate those
  modules by platform; neutral protocol/store tests still run on macOS.
- Concurrent `ProfileStore::upsert` operations could lose unrelated profiles
  or collide on the temporary file. Serialize write transactions on the shared
  store instance. A 12-thread regression failed before the fix and passed after.
  This lock does not provide coordination between separate processes or store
  instances pointing at the same file.
- Profile documents lacked private Unix permissions. Protect their directory
  and temporary document before atomic rename. The permission regression failed
  before the fix and now verifies modes 0700/0600.
- Xray profile validation accepted HTTP port 0 and identical SOCKS/HTTP ports.
  The regression failed before the fix; both invalid states are now rejected.
- Linux ARM64 daemon compilation referenced x86_64-only managed Xray helpers.
  ARM64 now builds and returns `Unsupported` for that managed executable;
  this does not add an ARM64 Xray package. Architecture-specific regression passed.
- Strict Linux clippy found three nonminimal boolean conditions in DNS/staging
  cleanup. Apply equivalent expressions and re-run the Linux tests.
- WireGuard E2E required a host `wg` tool although the documented prerequisite
  is Docker. Generate test keys through `wg` inside the disposable containers;
  the full integration suite passed with no host installation.
- Saved-profile warnings showed the old name or a new profile ID. Resolve the
  name from the returned saved profiles. Route lookup now asks for an IP literal
  rather than a hostname the backend does not resolve. The adapter panel close
  control has an accessible name.

### Remaining logic/display findings

1. **Linux local Xray auto-connect depends unnecessarily on the daemon.**
   `src-tauri/src/auto_connect.rs::connect_on_startup` calls `hello` and
   `owned.list` before starting any saved profile, even when all selected profiles
   are SOCKS Xray (`daemon_owner == None`). If the daemon is unavailable, local
   proxy auto-connect is skipped although the manual local process path does not
   require it. Separate local profiles from daemon-owned profiles and add an
   unavailable-daemon regression. Found by code inspection; not injected into a
   desktop Linux app during this session.
2. **Adapter details can display stale routes and hide read failures.**
   `src/components/InterfaceDetail.tsx` fetches only when `iface.ifIndex` changes,
   omits the `route-changed` subscription, and ignores errors. An open panel can
   keep an old route count; a failed initial read looks like an empty table.
   Subscribe and expose a read error. Found by code inspection.
3. **Traffic-flow profile identities and destination labels can mislead.**
   `src/components/RouteFlow.tsx` keys profiles by `ownerName`, so different
   profiles with the same permitted name merge. `destGroup` changes any IPv4
   prefix to `/16`, including broader routes such as `10.0.0.0/8`; this can show
   the wrong apparent coverage. The `/24` fixture rendered as `/16` in the UI.
   Use `ownerProfileId` for identity and mark aggregates clearly while preserving
   broader prefixes. Duplicate-name and broad-prefix cases were found by inspection.
4. **Occupied Xray HTTP listener preflight (fixed).**
   `src-tauri/src/commands/tunnels.rs::connect_profile` checks both generated
   listener ports and rewrites occupied SOCKS/HTTP ports in one managed revision.
   Unit tests cover HTTP-only and dual-port conflicts. A real Xray run with
   occupied ports remains unverified.

Sandbox browser logs included Tauri mock callback warnings during development
reloads/React effect cleanup; no browser error was observed in the completed
flows. These warnings are a mock-event limitation, not evidence of a native
backend failure. Production event behavior still needs platform UI acceptance.

## Linux daemon in a disposable container

`e2e/linux/run.sh` builds the daemon, starts an Ubuntu 26.04 (default) or
Fedora 44 (`E2E_DISTRO=fedora`; firewalld and resolved enabled, SELinux not
enforced in Docker) client and an Ubuntu peer container on a private Docker network, installs the service with systemd and
polkit in the client, and runs `scenarios.sh` there. The scenarios exercise
real netlink route and interface changes, polkit authorization, uid isolation,
restart recovery, shutdown cleanup, WireGuard and OpenVPN split/full tunnels
with real peer traffic and per-link DNS, OpenVPN management credentials,
Xray VLESS/Hysteria2 proxy through SOCKS5 and HTTP CONNECT, Xray TUN,
kernel policy-rule lookup, OpenVPN pushed-route probe, and WireGuard/static-route
always-on replay. Each container has
its own network namespace. Never run `scenarios.sh` directly on the host.

```bash
e2e/linux/run.sh
```

This requires Docker access and `/dev/net/tun`. `CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman`
runs the same suite under rootless Podman (systemd containers get
`--systemd=always` and `CAP_NET_RAW`, which `systemd-resolved` needs for
`SO_BINDTOINDEX` on per-link DNS sockets). The Xray scenarios take a host
binary via `XRAY_E2E_BINARY` (default `~/.local/bin/xray`) and pinned geo
assets via `XRAY_E2E_GEO_DIR` (default `~/.config/xray`, contents must match
the release hashes in `managed_xray.rs`). The harness grants the
client container `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, and unconfined AppArmor so systemd
can remount cgroup2. Use it on a development machine or CI worker that accepts
those container privileges. The peer container needs `CAP_NET_ADMIN`. The
current harness verifies the daemon and backends directly. Real Ubuntu desktop
interaction, polkit prompt rendering and login-session autostart still need VM
acceptance.

After building a `.deb` or `.rpm`, the packaged WebView-to-daemon static-route
path can be checked in another disposable container (Ubuntu for `.deb`,
Fedora 44 for `.rpm`):

```bash
e2e/linux/run_app_gui.sh --blank-config
e2e/linux/run_app_gui.sh target/release/bundle/rpm/*.rpm
```

This uses a container-only polkit rule for its headless user session, then
checks save/connect/disconnect through the installed app's WebView and the
kernel route table. It does not verify a visible polkit prompt or Wayland.

## macOS 27 native client

The native SwiftUI client is built with `npm run build:macos` (or
`bash scripts/build-macos-native.sh`). It uses the Rust core directly rather
than the Tauri IPC/browser sandbox. Build and test commands, the independent
data directory and current feature boundaries are documented in
[`../macos/README.md`](../macos/README.md).

On 2026-09-30 the arm64 release bundle was built and launched on macOS 27.0
with Xcode 27.0. Its Mach-O load command and Info.plist both specify 27.0 as
the minimum OS; local ad-hoc signing verifies. The binary links SwiftUI/AppKit
and does not link WebKit. RSS samples were 84.3 MiB for the initial instance
and 137.4 MiB immediately after launching the final foreground bundle; these
are not a comparative memory benchmark. The full macOS Rust workspace gate passed
(467 tests), along with four Swift integration tests and the TypeScript/Vite
production build. Native window interaction/screenshot acceptance remains
pending: the Computer Use helper repeatedly closed its pipe, including after
reset. Automated integration tests are not a substitute for visible UI checks.

Native bridge tests cover persisted profiles, CIDR validation/aggregation,
managed imports, failed-import cleanup, bounded C ABI buffers and refusal of
network mutations. Swift tests cover actual FFI decoding, persisted profiles,
imported-config analysis and read-only Darwin loopback inventory/route lookup.
Ordinary macOS tests never start real VPNs or apply routes, DNS or proxies.

### Shared dark/light design verification

On 2026-09-30 the native screens were restyled to match the Tauri icon rail,
cards, typography, filters, route tabs and dialogs. Both clients use generated
colors and core layout metrics from `design/tokens.json`, with a stale-output
check in their build commands. Native vector assets preserve the original
`src/icons.tsx` geometry and have a checked source hash.

The redesign passed fmt, all-target workspace check, strict clippy and all
467 ordinary Rust tests, TypeScript/Vite build and six sandbox tests. Six Swift
tests passed with `NETORCH_DESIGN_PREVIEWS` enabled, including packaged-icon
verification and 28 offscreen SwiftUI renders: five pages, six route tabs and
three creation/import dialogs in each theme. The native renderer uses an
injected temporary store and synthetic network data. The Tauri browser preview
was also checked by switching its Settings theme between Light and Dark.

PNG renders are under `target/macos/design-preview`, with `dark`/`light`
subdirectories and `tauri-dark.png`/`tauri-light.png` browser references. Exact
pixel parity and foreground native window interaction remain unverified;
the Computer Use helper was unavailable. OS-native chrome and unavailable
backend actions intentionally reflect macOS capabilities. No real VPN was
started and no host network settings were changed.

### Shared language verification

On 2026-09-30 English/Russian/System selectors were added to Tauri and SwiftUI.
Catalogs and plural rules are shared in `locales/*.json`; generated outputs
and native bundle language metadata are checked/derived during builds. Adding
a catalog does not require editing either client's language list. See
[`../locales/README.md`](../locales/README.md) for the translator workflow and
the boundary between UI translations and raw backend diagnostics.

RED: initial runtime tests failed before the translation helper existed.
GREEN: four translation runtime tests and six Python catalog-validation tests
passed, together with nine Swift tests (including 56 English/Russian renders
in dark/light), six sandbox tests and the full required Rust/web quality gate
(467 ordinary Rust tests). The ad-hoc signed native release bundle includes
both catalogs and declares the language tags in Info.plist.

Browser acceptance checked English persisting after reload, live Russian
switching across windows and an open profile form keeping its `Language check`
name and static-routes backend when its labels changed to Russian. The draft
was discarded without saving; the second test tab was closed. The browser
was left on Russian Settings. Native foreground interaction remains limited
by the unavailable Computer Use helper; native localization/persistence are
verified through tests and offscreen renders. The PNGs are under
`target/macos/i18n-preview/{en,ru}/{dark,light}`, with a browser reference at
`target/macos/i18n-preview/tauri-ru-settings.png`. No real VPN was started.

## Windows on a disposable VM

`crates/core/tests/windows_e2e.rs` contains opt-in integration scenarios that
exercise real WireGuard/OpenVPN/Xray binaries and mutate the routing table.
They are `#[ignore]`d, serialized behind a global mutex, and refuse to run
without explicit safety markers.

## Warning

These scenarios install tunnel services, spawn VPN processes, and change
routes. **Run them only inside a disposable Windows VM** with no production
connectivity requirements. A kill-switch fixture (`/0` route) is rejected by
the harness before any mutation.

## Safety gate

Before any mutation every scenario requires:

- `NETWORK_ORCHESTRATOR_E2E=disposable-windows-vm`
- `NETWORK_ORCHESTRATOR_E2E_ACK=routes-and-vpn-will-change`
- an elevated process token
- all used fixture paths to point to regular files
- no default route (`/0`) in the analyzed fixture profile

## Environment contract

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `NO_E2E_WG_CONFIG` | Path to a WireGuard `.conf` fixture |
| `NO_E2E_WG_INTERFACE` | Expected WireGuard interface friendly name |
| `NO_E2E_WG_CIDR` | Expected private CIDR installed by WireGuard |
| `NO_E2E_OVPN_CONFIG` | Path to an OpenVPN `.ovpn`/`.conf` fixture |
| `NO_E2E_OVPN_INTERFACE` | Expected OpenVPN TAP interface friendly name |
| `NO_E2E_OVPN_CIDR` | Expected private CIDR installed by OpenVPN |
| `NO_E2E_XRAY_CONFIG` | Path to an Xray JSON fixture |
| `NO_E2E_XRAY_LISTENER` | Optional `127.0.0.1:port` listener to probe |

Use only private ranges (for example `10.x.y.z/NN` placeholder CIDRs); never
commit real endpoints, keys, or URIs. Fixture values must live outside the
repository.

## Commands

```bash
# compile only (default `cargo test` never runs the mutating scenarios)
cargo test -p net-manager-core --test windows_e2e --no-run

# run on the fixture VM, elevated:
cargo test -p net-manager-core --test windows_e2e -- --ignored --test-threads=1
```

The `wireguard_killswitch_is_rejected_by_fixture_guard` test is not ignored —
it only verifies that the `/0` fixture guard refuses to connect, using a
temporary synthetic config.

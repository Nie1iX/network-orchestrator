# Changelog: Core

`net-manager-core` and `net-manager-engine`: the logic every product shares (models, static analysis, import, subscriptions, route planning, the daemon protocol, connection engines). Products ship a specific core version; their changelogs say which.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and the line follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Release rules: [`docs/versioning.md`](../docs/versioning.md). Everything up to
0.10.0, when the release lines were separated, is in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.18.1] - 2026-11-10

### Fixed

- Refresh Linux subscription catalogs in the shared unprivileged runtime without
  reconnecting active profiles, changing their listener ports or silently replacing
  a primary removed by the provider. Preserve real attempt times and safe errors.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-11-10

### Added

- Typed logging verbosity and additive daemon logging settings methods, shared by
  Linux GUI and CLI without changing VPN authorization or restarting tunnels.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-11-09

### Added

- Typed macOS profile, subscription, routing, network, provider, diagnostic,
  credential, policy and connection-set services shared by CLI and the Swift bridge.
- An authenticated per-data-directory macOS user-runtime owner with generation
  leases, serialized operations, owned-child recovery and durable proxy restoration.
- Shared connection-set storage with atomic, insert-only native legacy migration
  that preserves existing sets, missing references and full legacy names.
- Shared Linux lifecycle and IPC diagnostics with bounded private logs, safe
  error categories and nonblocking diagnostic writes during proxy recovery.

### Changed

- Import services take an explicit Xray mode: macOS links default to SOCKS
  without changing the Linux platform default.
- Persisted system-proxy ownership is bounded, protected against symlinked
  storage and read-only until an actual state change.

### Fixed

- Switching a stopped Xray TUN subscription node no longer requires its unused
  SOCKS/HTTP ports to be free. SOCKS mode still rejects an occupied listener.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-11-08

### Fixed

- Default the daemon VPN authorization mode to `noPrompt` when no settings
  have been saved; explicit administrator-selected modes remain unchanged.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-11-08

### Added

- Bounded Linux daemon event subscriptions shared by CLI and GUI, preserving
  partial frames across read timeouts and handling events during subscription.

### Fixed

- Keep in-memory system-proxy ownership when persisting the restored state fails,
  allowing a safe retry without losing the saved snapshot.
- Recover Linux user-proxy ownership under a persistent per-user lock and restore
  it before accepting new runtime commands.
- Compare whole-profile GUI replacements against an opaque canonical revision
  under the store lock; reject stale edits without losing concurrent narrow
  changes or hidden subscription metadata.
- Disconnect already-exited or health-reaped Xray/OpenVPN children cleanly,
  clearing their failure state; retain live child ownership if kill/reap fails.
- Explicitly release Linux proxy locks before descriptor close so concurrent
  fork/exec operations cannot retain ownership after runtime cleanup.
- Scan fragmented daemon event frames incrementally so large frames cannot cause
  quadratic processing and spurious observation timeouts.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-11-08

### Fixed

- Detect NetBird's default per-profile daemon socket when the legacy socket is
  absent, so a running service is not reported as stopped.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-11-07

### Added

- Shared Linux profile, network, service, diagnostic, system and connection-set
  operations for CLI and GUI clients.
- Retained connection preparation for safe set/endpoint cutovers, authenticated
  local-runtime capability negotiation and common WireGuard input validation.
- Canonical Linux Xray route derivation for dual-stack runtime and static
  analysis, including split-default and explicit IPv6 scope.

### Fixed

- Normalize IPv6 hosts from VLESS and Hysteria2 links before generating Xray
  server addresses, so transport dialing and literal endpoint bypasses use bare
  IPv6 addresses rather than bracketed URL authorities.
- Keep NetBird setup keys in inherited anonymous descriptors on Linux and track
  pending logins by process birth, executable, user and provider socket. A later
  frontend can cancel its own pending login without signaling unrelated processes.
- Reject symlinked NetBird runtime/log storage and report unsuccessful provider
  shutdowns instead of acknowledging a failed operation.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-11-07

### Added

- Shared Linux connection engine for static routes, WireGuard, OpenVPN, Xray TUN
  and local proxies; unprivileged per-data-directory runtime coordination keeps
  privileged mutations in the calling client and system daemon.
- Common Linux data paths, protected OpenVPN credential storage and bounded
  geodata preparation for both frontends.

### Fixed

- Serialize independent profile-store writers with an OS file lock; preserve
  concurrent narrow profile edits and routing-selector additions.
- Preserve concurrent metadata edits when rewriting generated listener ports.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- Strict data-only named proxy exit preferences: profile rules, a fixed
  subscription endpoint, an ordered pool, or direct, with explicit no-proxy
  exceptions and protected profile validation. Missing endpoint keys generate
  blackholes, not replacements; named nodes are excluded from automatic main
  pool recruitment without removing explicit primaries/manual backups.
- Linux connection plans carry dedicated named pin outbounds; the daemon
  protocol reports live bindings and per-pool health without subscription
  credentials or executable configuration.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-11-02

### Added

- Persisted user-owned HTTPS service-check specifications with empty/off defaults,
  protected profile validation and URL-redacted debug output. Bounded manual HEAD
  probes use only the current explicitly pinned subscription endpoint, never
  routing-derived targets, redirects, credentials or direct fallback.
- Typed, URL-free HTTP/timeout/TLS/transport/unavailable observations and a
  three-failure diagnostic streak, independent of tunnel recovery.

### Changed

- Replace inferred pinned-path status with explicit `serviceChecks` readings.
  Subscription refresh and ordinary profile edits retain service-check settings.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-11-02

### Added

- Secret-safe subscription endpoint keys, persisted backup references and
  pinned domain policies survive list reordering and credential rotation.
  Linux engine generation and the daemon protocol carry bounded multinode
  failover configuration and live node health.
- Typed advanced Xray routing/DNS/runtime settings and strict standalone-policy
  migration, with shared validation before generation, apply and persistence.
- Bounded exit-country probing and opt-in pool selection. Retained pools are
  sanitized against explicit choices, capacity and fresh country mismatches;
  disabled or newly pinned members cannot silently join default failover.

### Fixed

- Temporary delay and country probes wait for their Xray child to be killed
  and reaped before returning success, failure or timeout; cancellation retains
  the kill-on-drop guard.

# Changelog: Linux

The Linux app, the network daemon and `netorch` for Linux (they are versioned together; the packages are separate, see `docs/versioning.md`).

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and the line follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Release rules: [`docs/versioning.md`](../docs/versioning.md). Everything up to
0.10.0, when the release lines were separated, is in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Advertise implemented Mihomo commands during the daemon handshake so the
  optional-component installer and capability-aware clients can use them.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-11-12

Core 0.19.0.

### Added

- Edit a complete saved profile through synchronized JSON and a visual node graph.
  Inspect sources, ordered routing, DNS, endpoint references, pools and named exits;
  validation identifies unresolved references without silently retargeting traffic.
  Show only configured blocks and referenced endpoints; add functional blocks from
  a searchable catalog without changing the tunnel. Preserve incomplete drafts
  and unresolved references on the canvas.
- Preview generated Xray TUN settings through the daemon's read-only validator.
  Save drafts with optimistic revision checks without interrupting a running
  connection; apply a saved revision only through an explicit reconnect action.
- Optional Mihomo v1.19.34 component on x86_64, explicitly installed/removed through
  Settings or `netorch backend mihomo`. Import native configurations/subscriptions,
  edit group selections in the shared form/JSON/node editor, and choose daemon TUN
  or user-runtime mixed-proxy mode without changing existing Xray profiles.
  Preserve native provider filters, fallback and load balancing; enabled refresh
  updates protected snapshots without reconnecting an active profile.

### Fixed

- Accept validated socket options on Hysteria TUN outbounds instead of rejecting
  profiles produced by the shared connection planner.
- Keep connection failures visible on the selected profile with edit/diagnose
  actions until dismissal or a successful retry. Invalid transport errors identify
  the generated outbound location without exposing configuration values.
- Identify rejected backup, pinned and DNS endpoints by record ID and preserve safe
  conversion advice for unrepresentable provider graph options.
- Use persistent subscription record IDs throughout connection planning and probes
  so provider address changes do not discard selections or merge distinct records.
- Independently validate scoped provider selection graphs, transport dependencies
  and observation subjects without flattening multi-server subscription sources.
- Accept explicit profile interface bindings on validated non-source freedom
  outbounds; keep source-injected bindings and conflicting observer types blocked.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-11-10

Core 0.18.1.

### Fixed

- Run enabled subscription auto-refresh in the unprivileged `netorch serve`
  runtime instead of the Linux GUI, including while connected. Keep running
  connections unchanged, retain removed primary nodes as missing, and share real
  attempt timestamps and redacted failure status with GUI and CLI.
- Require DNS-independent HTTPS failure confirmation before the watchdog
  restarts an Xray TUN, avoiding connection drops caused only by resolver outages.
- Keep the profile Routing editor usable when serialized DNS settings omit empty
  server or host collections instead of crashing the entire application window.
- Terminate native journald fields correctly so debug/trace records and automatic
  hang snapshots are retained rather than silently discarded by journald.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-11-10

Core 0.18.0.

### Added

- Live daemon diagnostic verbosity (`normal`, `debug`, `trace`) in Logs and
  `netorch logs verbosity [normal|debug|trace]`. The daemon persists one shared
  setting; changing it does not restart tunnels or alter VPN authorization.
- Bounded, asynchronous thread snapshots on Xray stop and netlink timeouts,
  including wait channels, syscall numbers and available kernel frame names.
  Snapshots remain enabled at normal verbosity; unavailable kernel stacks are
  reported without widening service privileges.
- Debug HTTPS failure categories and trace request, core-lock and netlink
  queue/execution timings. Verbose metadata uses nonblocking journald output
  and its retention/rate limits; client logs retain their existing size cap.
  No configs, credentials, URLs, syscall arguments or process memory are logged.

### Fixed

- Resolve NetworkManager VPN tunnel interfaces through their shared IPv4/IPv6
  configuration instead of the physical underlay, preventing duplicate OpenVPN
  entries under detected system tunnels.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-11-09

Core 0.17.0.

### Added

- `versions.py prepare` automates release metadata, changelog promotion, lockfile
  refresh and the host quality gate, with a no-write preview and a project skill.
- Failure diagnostics across GUI/CLI, shared engine, user runtime and daemon:
  lifecycle and IPC outcomes, safe frontend/Rust panic context, child exit
  codes/signals, watchdog restart reasons, netlink failures and cleanup results.
  Persist bounded client logs and omit raw configs, credentials and traffic tails.

## [0.16.3] - 2026-11-09

Core 0.16.1.

### Fixed

- Associate NetBird and Tailscale service rows with their tunnel interfaces by
  reported addresses, showing the interface names without duplicate external
  rows. Keep unrelated tunnels and interfaces with unknown ownership visible.

## [0.16.2] - 2026-11-08

Core 0.16.1.

### Changed

- Open directly to Profiles and remove the redundant Home dashboard and its
  navigation shortcuts. Connection controls remain in Profiles and the tray.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-11-08

Core 0.16.1.

### Changed

- Default VPN authorization to `noPrompt` for installations without saved
  daemon settings. Active local sessions can connect full and split tunnels
  without a password; existing administrator-selected modes and system-network
  authorization are unchanged. Invalid settings still require a password.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-11-08

Core 0.16.0.

### Added

- Headless `netorch watch` JSONL snapshots, `diagnose` findings and explicit
  `recover` reporting/`recover --cleanup` for current-user resource teardown.
- Disposable CLI-first acceptance covering the native GUI, daemon lifetime,
  foreground signals, real local Xray and user-proxy crash recovery.

### Changed

- System daemon connections now outlive all CLI/GUI clients without a
  `netorch serve` keeper. Explicit disconnect, backend shutdown and recovery
  still clean owned resources. The user runtime is needed only for local
  Xray SOCKS/HTTP and user proxy supervision.
- GUI and CLI share bounded daemon event subscriptions; reconnect and event gaps
  refresh snapshots, while unavailable status is never cached as running.
- JSON-mode usage and operation failures have structured stderr and stable
  exit codes (2 and 1 respectively).

### Fixed

- Restore saved proxy settings when the user runtime restarts after failure;
  persist global ownership outside the session directory so another data root
  cannot adopt an unrestored proxy after logout or reboot.
- Roll back daemon-owned routes as well as local Xray when a mixed connection's
  route-apply reply is lost or malformed; preserve both cleanup errors.
- Reject stale GUI profile/config-form saves after CLI edits instead of
  overwriting newer names, routes or subscription settings.
- Allow explicit disconnect after local Xray dies and proxy rollback completes,
  rather than leaving a failed session that cannot be cleared.
- Release proxy ownership immediately even when another thread has forked a child
  that has not yet executed its program.
- Avoid repeated full-buffer scans while receiving daemon events, including
  oversized frames that must be rejected without exposing their contents.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-11-08

Core 0.15.1.

### Fixed

- Show the connected NetBird service when it uses a per-profile daemon socket.
- Exclude NetworkManager's external-device placeholders (including NetBird's
  `wt0`) from controllable VPN/WireGuard profiles; keep NM-managed connections.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-11-07

Core 0.15.0.

### Added

- CLI access to Linux profile settings, subscriptions, network routes/rules and
  DNS, provider services, always-on and conditional routing, diagnostics, logs,
  backend management and saved connection sets through shared Engine services.
- Dual-stack Linux Xray TUN capture, IPv6-only scoped routes, IPv6 tunnel
  addresses and negotiated daemon capability checks before network mutations.
- Shared protected connection sets with legacy GUI migration and explicit,
  per-profile OpenVPN credential input for interactive and CLI application.

### Changed

- Linux GUI commands use the same business operations as the CLI rather than a
  separate in-process tunnel/settings implementation.
- Connection-set and subscription endpoint changes validate retained connection
  inputs before teardown and restore previously running connections on failure;
  failed resources are cleaned without being restored as healthy connections.

### Fixed

- Scope fake-DNS pools to captured address families and route coverage; avoid
  claiming IPv4 default capture for explicit IPv6-only scopes.
- Preserve concurrent named-exit changes and cached subscription HWIDs.
- Keep remembered OpenVPN credentials unchanged after failed/unconfirmed
  connection attempts and protect unknown-status/always-on resources.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-11-07

Core 0.14.0.

### Added

- Shared unprivileged `netorch serve` user service for local Xray SOCKS/HTTP
  children and detached daemon connection lifetime. CLI and GUI control the
  same runtime; closing the window does not terminate it.
- Raw Xray JSON import in the CLI, defaulting to unprivileged SOCKS mode.
- Arch/CachyOS packages include GUI, CLI, daemon, pinned Xray, shell completions
  and tmpfiles configuration; Debian GUI installers also include the CLI runtime.

### Changed

- Linux CLI and GUI use one connection engine, data-directory convention,
  OpenVPN credential store and geodata preparation. CLI profile changes refresh
  the open GUI. OS file locks protect cross-process profile edits.
- Replace per-profile CLI keeper processes with the shared user service.
  A systemd user manager (or foreground `netorch serve`) is required; retaining
  user units across logout requires explicit linger configuration.
- Root connects require foreground mode. Foreground terminal hangup disconnects
  instead of leaving a shared connection running.

### Fixed

- Show a ready Xray executable with an unknown version as ready, not absent.
- Update vulnerable frontend build dependencies within compatible ranges.
- Preserve automatic installation marks when upgrading shared daemon/CLI dependencies.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-11-03

Core 0.13.0.

### Fixed

- Accept geosite category names containing `!` (for example,
  `category-ai-chat-!cn`) at the daemon boundary, matching generated profile
  rules. External asset selectors and path traversal remain rejected.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-11-03

Core 0.13.0.

### Added

- `netorch proxy set|list|remove` and `netorch proxy [--profile PROFILE] NAME --
  COMMAND` for user-defined rules/node/pool/direct exits of a connected Xray
  TUN profile. Configuration is offline; launches verify actual daemon bindings
  and never start/reload the tunnel. Stale exits refuse before execution.
- Independent ordered pool controllers with fail-closed missing/all-down
  members, and marked direct sockets that bypass the owned TUN. Commands retain
  literal arguments, terminal, native signals and exit status through `exec`;
  inherited HTTP/SOCKS proxy and no-proxy variables are replaced.
- Disposable real-CLI coverage of full-TUN direct bypass, pool affinity and
  isolation, failed exits, explicit bypass exceptions, command lifetime and
  listener cleanup. Loopback listeners remain unauthenticated; environment
  proxies are not process network isolation or arbitrary UDP routing.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-11-02

Core 0.12.0.

### Added

- `netorch checks list|add|remove|background|run` and a per-profile service
  availability editor. Users supply the HTTPS targets and explicit node pins;
  opening or saving the editor sends no service request.
- Opt-in diagnostic-only checks every 60 seconds while a TUN profile is active.
  Any HTTP response is transport evidence, not authenticated API success.
  Results and transition logs omit URLs; disabling/removing checks cancels the
  worker without reloading Xray, changing pins or selecting a fallback.

### Changed

- Stop inferring pinned service targets from routing domains and remove
  pin-specific restart requests. Global tunnel/failover health and underlay
  recovery remain separate from service-specific availability.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-11-02

Core 0.11.0.

### Added

- Xray subscription profiles can select ordered backup nodes and pin domain
  selectors to independent nodes from the app or `netorch backup` and
  `netorch route pin|unpin`. The daemon uses bounded HTTPS probes per node,
  prefers the primary and automatically returns after recovery. Missing pins
  stay fail-closed; all-down default traffic is blocked, never sent direct.
  Live status includes the selected node and candidate health.
- Opt-in filtered backup pools and real exit-country verification in the app
  and CLI. Country-only filters are supported; explicit domain/DNS nodes are
  excluded from automatic recruitment, and name-only mode does not need Xray.
- Stopped-profile preview/apply of standalone Xray policies, including fixed
  egress, DNS rewriting, IP/port guards, interface policies, TUN MTU/DNS and
  connection/socket settings. Unsupported semantics and conflicting pins
  refuse the whole import; ordinary profile edits preserve imported settings.
- Owned-child recovery for real underlay changes, HTTPS/pin stalls and UDP
  socket accumulation, with DNS and application connection-storm diagnostics.
  Unchanged DHCP identity preserves live streams; recovery waits while offline.
- Tunnel-scoped nftables QUIC rejection with ownership-safe cleanup.
- Single-file Debian/Ubuntu installers for CLI and GUI, each bundling its client
  and the shared daemon package. They install missing packages, update older
  versions, preserve a newer daemon patch from the same release line, and refuse
  client downgrades. `--check` previews the version plan without root or changes;
  `--yes` accepts the APT plan. A CLI-only build avoids the GUI/WebKit toolchain.

### Changed

- Linux Xray is pinned to 26.10.31 for DNS rewriting. Bundled GeoIP Lite and
  GeoSite Standard replace the old data set; explicit geodata overrides remain
  supported, and package notices describe the current data licenses.

### Fixed

- Endpoint bypasses migrate from an existing old gateway/interface without
  adopting foreign routes. Recovery acknowledges replaced children, cancels
  positively cleared queued stalls and does not charge a crash against the
  independent stall cooldown.
- Orphan cleanup verifies protected process ownership independently of the
  current Xray pin, including a deleted executable from an older package.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-10-30

Core 0.10.0.

### Added

- `netorch route` manages the routing rules of Xray profiles from the terminal:
  `show` lists them, `add` and `rm` change single selectors, `set` replaces
  all of them, and `check <host or IP> --profile <profile>` tells which rule
  decides it. Selectors are `domain:`, `full:`, `geosite:`, `geoip:`, an address
  or a CIDR network. A bare name such as `ru` is a substring match in Xray, and
  the command says so. A connected profile applies the change when it
  reconnects.
- `netorch version` also shows the core version the build includes.

### Changed

- The Linux `.deb` is split into three packages that share this line's
  version: `network-orchestrator-daemon` (the daemon, its systemd unit, the
  polkit policy and the pinned Xray), `netorch` (the command line client, with
  bash, zsh and fish completions) and `network-orchestrator` (the app). The
  app and `netorch` depend on a daemon of their own `major.minor` or newer, so
  installing either keeps a suitable daemon as it is and installs or upgrades
  an unsuitable one; the former single package is replaced
  (`Replaces`/`Breaks`, including version 0.10.0). A server needs only the
  daemon and `netorch`:
  `apt install ./network-orchestrator-daemon_*.deb ./netorch_*.deb`.
  `.rpm` and Arch packages are still one package.

### Fixed

- For supported TCP/raw, Hysteria and KCP transports, a system-wide Xray tunnel
  no longer stops carrying traffic when its server is given by name. The daemon
  now resolves the name before the tunnel comes up and has Xray dial the IP
  (the name stays the TLS/Reality server name), so a
  reconnect no longer needs the resolver that points into the tunnel. Because
  the server no longer has to be looked up, the DNS servers are not routed
  around the tunnel any more: on networks that drop DNS to outside resolvers
  the profile's DNS now works through the tunnel.
